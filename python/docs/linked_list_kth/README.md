# Challenge Summary
Expand on the linked list challenge from last week,
Return the Value of the Node K spaces from the end of the linked list

## Whiteboard Process
[Whiteboard](docs/linked_list_kth/Blank board.jpeg)
## Approach & Efficiency
* kth_from_end:
Create a method on the linked_list class
Take in K as input, where K is the value from the end of the linked list to return
Increment a length variable for each node in the linked list.
Handle Errors or incorrect input raising Target Error
length of list - k -1 now gives us the value of the input
return value

Big O of O(n) The complexity will scale based on the size of the input dataset.

## Solution
You would run Linked_list.py in the terminal calling the methods within.
its not currently an executable code base.
