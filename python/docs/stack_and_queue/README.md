# Challenge Summary
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Whiteboard Process
[Whiteboard](docs/stack_queue_animal_shelter/StackQueueShelter.png)
## Approach & Efficiency
We Create two queues in our AnimalShelter __Init__
Enqueue method checks if input is class Dog, then enqueue to the dog queue, Or if input is class Cat, enqueue to cat queue
Dequeue, accepts a string 'cat' or 'dog' and returns the animal at the head of that queue, The first in node.

The Time is 0(1)
The Space is 0(1)

## Solution
You would run stack.py or queue.py in the terminal calling the methods within.
its not currently an executable code base.
