## Approach & Efficiency
Function begins by defining a climb function
If there is no root, we return none.
We then compare our root value against a temp Max variable.â€¨we procced to climb through the tree recursively calling our climb function. If root.value > max value re reassign max value to root.value


The Big O time and space is O(n) since we need to check every node in the tree
