# Singly Linked List
This class structure builds out a linked list, and allows you to add nodes to it through a sub class.

## Challenge
Create a linked list structure with a Node class, with properties for the value stored in the Node,
and a pointer to the next Node. Build this structure out to pass the supplied unit tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
I referenced alot of documentation and guides, And sourced these in the linked_list.py.

To begin this problem, i read through the first article linked. Then set to work, first by examining the unit tests.
Then by following the Pass/fail/refactor cycle. I got my first test to pass, by brute force. then modified my code
to be fully functional per the structure of a linked list. Until the test passed again. Then i moved onto the next
test.
